First of all there were much less passengers embarking in the last two ports: only 77 passengers in Queenstown and 168 passengers in Cherbourg. We could guess, considering large number of passengers, that the third class passengers embarked mostly in Southhampton and Queenstown and that could be the reason for such small, as compared to Cherbourg port, survival ratio for passengers embarking here.

    "In this analysis we worked with Titanic survival dataset for 891 passengers data out of all 2224 Titanic passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first answered what was Titanic passengers demographic structure analyzed in terms of attributes. We see that vast majority (55.11%) of passengers travelled in lowest third class, almost 25% of passengers travelled in first class and 20.65% traveled in second class. Majority of all passengers were males: 64.76% with only 35.24% of females. 10.78% of passengers were children in age 0-14. A little over 28% of passengers were both between 14-24 and 24-34 years old. Almost 17% of all passengers were 34-44 years old. Only 16% of all passengers were above 44 years old. That tells us that Titanic passengers population was quite young.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vast majority of passengers travelled without any siblings or spouse - 68.24%. 23.46% of passengers travelled with one child or spouse. Less than 9% of all passengers traveled with more than one sibling or spouse. The situation is very similar in case of passengers travelling with parents or children. Most of them (76.09%) travelled alone and 13.24% travelled with just one parent or children. 8.89% of passengers travelled with two parents or children. In terms of ticket fare over the half (57.08%) of passengers paid the lowest fare ranging from 0 to 20. 22.83% passengers paid between 20 and 40 fare. We saw that the rest of the ticket prices (20.11%) varies very much ranging from 40 to 600. We can see that vast majority of passengers embarked in Southampton (72.44%), 18.9% embarked in Cherbourg and only 8.66% of passengers embarked Titanic in Queenstown.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this part of analysis by accident we found error in the Titanic dataset. We found out that person appearing in the dataset as the oldest age (80) is the age of actual death many years after person disaster survival. This means that dataset age information for this passenger, by error, contains value of post Titanic death age and not the day of disaster age as it does for other survived passengers age attribute values. This inconsistency makes the data invalid and confusing when it comes to factual or historical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We answered what is the overall Titanic passengers survival ratio. We found out that from Titanic 891 passengers only 342 survived and 549 died. The Titanic survival ratio is approximately 0.3838, meaning that only 38.38% of all passengers survived the disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we turned to the survival ratio for different demographic passengers groups analysis. As for passengers classes survival ratio, the survival ratio for the first class passengers was 0.63. Second class had a bit lower survival ratio of 0.47. But comparing that to the third class passengers survival ration of 0.24 is shocking. All three passengers classes effects are significant with p < .05. Looking at gender based survival differences we also see clear relationship in terms of survival ratio values. Clearly women were more likely to survive than men with 0.74 survival ration for women and 0.18 for men. Both gender effects are significant with p < .05. As for age groups survival ratio passengers in the age group of 0-14 have much higher survival ratio of 0.58 than the rest of passengers. Other passengers age groups oscillate around the overall survival ratio of 0.38. All ages groups besides (54, 64] group effects are significant with p < .05.\n",

    "As for passengers travelling with different number of siblings or spouse passengers travelling without any had survival ratio of 0.35. Passengers travelling with one and two sibling or spouse had higher survival chances of 0.54 and 0.46. Only passengers travelling without any and with one sibling/spouse effects are significant with p < .05. Considering groups of passengers depending on the number of parents and children they travelled with, again passengers travelling without any children or parents with survival ratio of 0.34. We can see that passengers travelling with one, two or three children or parents had bigger chances of survival (0.55, 0.50 and 0.60 accordingly), but again let's remember that these groups had much less passengers (118, 80, 5).
