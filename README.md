# Titanic passengers survival analysis Kaggle competition

In this notebook we will conduct data analysis of Titanic passengers survival dataset for Kaggle [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

Titanic passengers survival dataset is one of the most canonical data analysis and machine learning datasets. Let's see how this data looks like, investigate main trends in it and try to predict survival chances of passengers based on numerous data attributes.

To see the analysis open above Jupyter notebook file or click [here](https://github.com/msznajder/titanic_survival_analysis_kaggle/blob/master/titanic_passengers_survival_analysis_kaggle_competition.ipynb).

## Framing the problem 

Titanic sinking was one of the biggest shipwreck tragedies in history. It killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers. This tragedy led to better safety regulations for ships. The main reason for such a great death toll was not enough number of lifeboats to fit all passengers. This can lead to the conclusion that some groups of people were more likely to survive than others - woman, children and upper-class passeners for example.

The goal of this analysis is to analyse the data set, explore it answering related questions using data visualization and statistical methods. There are also some questions we would like to answer with Titanic dataset analysis.

* What is Titanic passengers demographic structure analyzed in terms of attributes?

* What is the overall Titanic passengers survival ratio?

* What is the survival ratio for different demographic passengers groups? Which groups have biggest chances for survival and which smallest? Is the difference between survived group statistically significant?
